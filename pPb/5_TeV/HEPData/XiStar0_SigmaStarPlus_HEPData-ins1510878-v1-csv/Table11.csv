#: description: $p_{\rm T}$-integrated yield d$N$/d$y$ of ($\Sigma^{*\pm}+\overline{\Sigma}^{*\mp}$)/4 in p-Pb collisions with centre-of-mass energy/nucleon=5.02 TeV. Yields are normalised to the visible cross section for each V0A multiplicity event class and to NSD events for the minimum bias case.
