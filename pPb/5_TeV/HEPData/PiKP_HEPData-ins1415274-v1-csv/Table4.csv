#: name: Table 4
#: description: pT-differential invariant yield of charged kaons in p-Pb collisions with centre-of-mass energy/nucleon=5.02 TeV, measured for NSD events.
The first uncertainty is statistical, the second one is the total systematic uncertainty, while the third one is the uncorrelated systematic uncertainty which is multiplicity dependent.
