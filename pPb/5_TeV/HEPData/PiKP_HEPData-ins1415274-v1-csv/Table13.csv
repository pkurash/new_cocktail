#: name: Table 13
#: description: pT-integrated charged kaon to charged pion and proton+antiproton to charged pion production ratios as a function of average multiplicities in p-Pb collisions with centre-of-mass energy/nucleon=5.02 TeV, measured for different V0A multiplicity classes. The first uncertainty is statistical, the second one is the total systematic uncertainty, while the third one is the uncorrelated systematic uncertainty which is multiplicity dependent.
